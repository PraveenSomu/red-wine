          <p>** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **
            Best fine dine restaurant in Erode with greater ambiance.. the food served here are
            delicious and unique recipe type menu. Can't get such a better option to dine in with family
            at Erode. Ample parking space with a hall facility in the first floor. Overall, highly
            recommend for family and kids. Especially new wed couples will love it.

          <p>A classy and aesthetically pleasing restaurant/hangout space , probably one of the
            finest in
            Erode. Really good food - you get to sample a variety of cuisines. I didn‚Äôt feel bloated
            even after a heavy dinner here - proof that they choose good ingredients to make their food.
            Surprisingly light on the wallet for the quality of the dishes served.. üëç

          <p>It was such a wonderful restaurant ever in Erode. The ambience scores everything.
            The
            hospitality of the staff was too good. Obviously the taste is extraordinary. The one I like
            the most here is tandoori chicken. They start making it once after the order is given unlike
            in other restaurant it was..
            previously half cookedThey have separatemaster for tandoori who
            was from Malasiya. I‚Äôve visited more than 6 times in 2 months. It‚Äôs a must visit restaurant
            for foodies and obviously everyone out there who‚Äôs checking for something new in the city.</p>

            last
            valentine day) The food is absolutely amazing ‚Äì everything we tasted melted in other mouths
            (our Favourite illaneer Paayasam) Thank you one fine day the must visit restaurant.</p>
